To unlock Formbricks Enterprise Edition features, you need to activate your Enterprise License Key. Follow these steps to activate your license:

## 1. Set the License Key

Add your Enterprise License Key as an environment variable in your deployment:

```bash
ENTERPRISE_LICENSE_KEY=
```

- Add your Enterprise License Key after `ENTERPRISE_LICENSE_KEY=` with the key you received from Formbricks.
- How you set environment variables depends on your deployment (Docker, Kubernetes, .env file, etc.).

## 2. Restart Your Instance

After setting the environment variable, **restart your Formbricks instance** to apply the changes.

## 3. Ensure Network Access to License Server

Formbricks needs to verify your license key with the Enterprise License server. Make sure your server can reach the following URL: 


[https://ee.formbricks.com/api/licenses/check](https://ee.formbricks.com/api/licenses/check)

## 4. Verify License Activation
