## Telemetry Implementation

### Community Edition Telemetry
The Community Edition currently implements basic telemetry through a simple system:

1. **Basic Usage Metrics**
   - Anonymous instance identification using hashed CRON_SECRET
   - Basic usage statistics:
     - Survey count
     - Response count
     - User count
   - Version tracking
   - Can be disabled via `TELEMETRY_DISABLED=1` environment variable

2. **Implementation Details**
   - Uses a dedicated telemetry endpoint (`telemetry.formbricks.com`)
   - Data is collected anonymously
   - No personal or customer data is transmitted
   - Simple event-based system with minimal properties

3. **Current Limitations**
   - Very basic metrics only
   - No feature usage tracking
   - No error tracking
   - No performance metrics
   - No user behavior insights

### Enterprise Edition Telemetry
The Enterprise Edition currently has no dedicated telemetry system:

1. **Current State**
   - No specific telemetry for enterprise features
   - No usage tracking for enterprise features
   - No monitoring of license usage patterns
   - No insights into feature adoption

2. **Missing Capabilities**
   - No tracking of enterprise feature usage
   - No monitoring of license validation patterns
   - No insights into limit usage and patterns
   - No tracking of enterprise-specific errors
   - No monitoring of enterprise feature performance

3. **Impact**
   - Limited ability to understand enterprise customer needs
   - No data to drive enterprise feature development
   - No insights into enterprise feature adoption
   - Limited ability to proactively address issues
   - No data to inform enterprise pricing decisions

This lack of telemetry in the Enterprise Edition represents a significant gap in our ability to understand and improve the product for enterprise customers. It makes it difficult to:
- Track feature adoption and usage patterns
- Identify common issues and pain points
- Make data-driven decisions about feature development
- Provide proactive support
- Understand enterprise customer needs and behaviors
